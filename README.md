# Jacob-deGrom-Post-Game-Pitching-Report

Post game report similar to the ones given to the pitchers at Virginia Tech after each start. Comprehensive report that allows pitchers and coaches to see areas of strengths and weaknesses through visualizations and charts. This included VAA plots, pitch speed bands, spin bands, whiff plots, swing tendencies, and quality of contact plots all broken down by pitch.

This is the R-mardown file I used to make the pdf.
